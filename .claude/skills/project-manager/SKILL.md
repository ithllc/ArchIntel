# Project Manager Skill ("The Architect")

## Overview

The Project Manager is a **Meta-Agent** that orchestrates up to 3 parallel Claude Code CLI sessions ("Workers") to execute development tasks autonomously. It uses:

- **Git Worktrees** for environment isolation (no file conflicts)
- **Affinity Scheduling** to minimize context switching
- **Greenfield/Brownfield** strategies for optimal prompting
- **Autonomous execution** with no human-in-the-loop for sub-processes

Target throughput: **15 tasks/day**

## When to Use

- Executing multiple development tasks in parallel
- Batch processing of backlog items (bugs, features, refactors)
- Large-scale refactoring across multiple domains
- Automated code generation campaigns

## Quick Start

```bash
# Invoke the skill
/project-manager

# Or with initial tasks
/project-manager --tasks "Add auth middleware" "Fix pagination bug" "Refactor user model"
```

## Key Commands

### Start Orchestration
```bash
# Start with default settings (3 workers)
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/orchestrate.py start

# Start with custom worker count
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/orchestrate.py start --workers 2
```

### Monitor Status
```bash
# View real-time status
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/orchestrate.py status

# View metrics dashboard
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/metrics.py dashboard
```

### Kill Switch (Emergency Stop)
```bash
# Graceful shutdown - saves state and terminates all workers
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/orchestrate.py kill

# Force kill (immediate, still saves state)
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/orchestrate.py kill --force
```

### Manage Tasks
```bash
# Add tasks to backlog
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/state_manager.py add-task \
    --title "Add user authentication" \
    --domain "auth" \
    --type "feature"

# List all tasks
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/state_manager.py list

# Move task status
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/state_manager.py update-task \
    --id 3 --status DONE
```

## Architecture

### Components

| Component | File | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| Orchestrator | `orchestrate.py` | "The Boss" - manages workers and worktrees |
| Scheduler | `scheduler.py` | "Traffic Controller" - affinity-based task assignment |
| Context Curator | `context_curator.py` | "Briefing Officer" - generates prompts |
| State Manager | `state_manager.py` | "The Scribe" - JSON/MD sync |
| Metrics | `metrics.py` | Performance tracking and reporting |

## Task Workflow

### States
```
TODO → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW → DONE
         ↓
      FAILED (retry_count > 3 → escalate)
```

### Affinity Scheduling

Tasks are tagged with:
- **domain**: `auth`, `api`, `frontend`, `database`, `infra`, etc.
- **type**: `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`

Workers maintain "sticky" domain affinity - a worker that just completed an `auth` task will preferentially receive another `auth` task to leverage loaded context.

### Context Curation (2-Paragraph Rule)

**Paragraph 1 - Objective:**
- High-level goal
- Definition of Done
- Expected output

**Paragraph 2 - Constraints:**
- Technical boundaries
- Banned libraries/patterns
- Required patterns to follow

## Git Worktree Isolation

Each worker operates in an isolated worktree:
```
project-root/
├── main/                     # Original repo (untouched during work)
├── worktree-1/               # Worker 1's isolated environment
├── worktree-2/               # Worker 2's isolated environment
└── worktree-3/               # Worker 3's isolated environment
```

Workers create branches, make changes, and upon verification, the orchestrator merges completed work back to main.

## Kill Switch

The kill switch provides safe emergency shutdown:

1. **Signal Propagation**: Sends SIGTERM to all worker subprocesses
2. **State Preservation**: Saves current state to `kanban_state.json` and backup
3. **Graceful Timeout**: Workers get 10 seconds to clean up before SIGKILL
4. **Worktree Protection**: Preserves worktree state for manual recovery

```bash
# Graceful kill (recommended)
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/orchestrate.py kill

# Immediate force kill
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/orchestrate.py kill --force
```

State backups are saved to: `memory/backups/state_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

## Monitoring

### Real-time Dashboard
```bash
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/metrics.py dashboard
```

Displays:
- Active workers and their current tasks
- Queue depth and estimated completion
- Success/failure rates
- Token usage per task
- Domain distribution

### Log Files
- `memory/logs/orchestrator.log` - Main orchestration events
- `memory/logs/worker_N.log` - Per-worker output
- `memory/logs/execution_history.jsonl` - Structured execution log

### Metrics Export
```bash
# Export to CSV for analysis
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/metrics.py export --format csv

# Export to JSON
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/metrics.py export --format json
```

## GitHub Issues Integration

Pull issues from the workspace's associated remote GitHub repository and ingest them as kanban tasks.

### Pull Issues
```bash
# Fetch all open issues from the remote repo
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/github_issues.py pull

# Fetch with filters
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/github_issues.py pull --label "bug" --limit 25
```

### Ingest as Tasks
```bash
# Convert pulled GitHub Issues into kanban tasks
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/github_issues.py ingest
```

**Automatic Mapping:**
| GitHub | Kanban |
|--------|--------|
| `bug` label | type: `bugfix` |
| `enhancement` label | type: `feature` |
| `testing` label | type: `test` |
| `severity:blocker` | priority: P0 |
| `severity:major` | priority: P1 |
| `severity:moderate` | priority: P2 |
| `severity:minor` | priority: P3 |
| `severity:cosmetic` | priority: P4 |
| "Depends on #N" in body | task dependency |

### Sync Status
```bash
# Update GitHub Issues when kanban tasks change status
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/github_issues.py sync-status

# Close GitHub Issues when tasks reach DONE
python .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/github_issues.py sync-status --close-on-done
```

### Repository Detection
Automatically reads remote origin from `git remote -v` for the current workspace. Works with any GitHub repository.

### Resolve and View Issue Images
When pulling issues, always check for embedded images (screenshots, wireframes, mockups) that provide critical visual context:

1. **Extract full issue body** via REST API: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number} --jq '.body'`
2. **Download images** (GitHub asset URLs redirect to S3): `curl -sL -o /tmp/issue{N}_img.png "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/{uuid}"`
3. **View with Read tool**: Claude Code is multimodal — use the Read tool on downloaded images to visually interpret wireframes, mockups, bug screenshots, and UI annotations
4. **Incorporate into task context**: Image-derived context (layout intentions, UI element placement, flow arrows) should be captured in the kanban task description for accurate implementation

### Post Implementation Comments
After completing work on a GitHub Issue (task reaches DONE or REVIEW), ALWAYS post a comment on the issue summarizing:

1. **What was done**: Concise summary of changes made (files modified, what was added/removed/changed)
2. **How to test**: Step-by-step instructions for verification
3. **Command**: `gh issue comment {number} --body "## Implementation Summary\n- ...\n\n## How to Test\n1. ..."`
4. **Timing**: Comment immediately after implementation, before moving to the next task. This ensures traceability between code changes and issue requirements.

**Prerequisite:** `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).

## Error Handling

### Automatic Retry
- Failed tasks return to queue with `retry_count + 1`
- Max retries: 3 (configurable)

### Escalation
After 3 failures:
1. Task marked as `ESCALATED`
2. Details logged to `memory/logs/escalations.log`
3. Notification added to `KANBAN_BOARD.md`
4. Human review required before retry

## Integration

### With feedback-helper
```bash
# After escalation, get human feedback
/feedback-helper --context "project-manager task failure"
```

### With skill-evolution-manager
Automatically triggered at end of batch to:
- Analyze failure patterns
- Update `learned_context.md`
- Propose workflow improvements

## Configuration

Edit `kanban_state.json` config section:
```json
{
  "config": {
    "max_workers": 3,
    "max_retries": 3,
    "daily_task_limit": 15,
    "worktree_base": "../worktrees",
    "graceful_timeout_seconds": 10
  }
}
```
